If you have a Huidu HD-WF4 led controller and want to update it from code, without using Huidu SDKs, this project maybe will be useful to you.

We leverage the "Real-time area" functionality of this controller to update the entire screen with an image of our choosing.

This was reverse engineered from captured packets sent from HDSign. Tested on a 160x32 Full Color screen, which can show 8 different colors.
